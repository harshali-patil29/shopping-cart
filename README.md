# Shopping Cart

The shopping cart project is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse a list of products, add items to their cart, adjust quantities, and view the total price dynamically. This project serves as a practical demonstration of basic web development concepts such as DOM manipulation and event handling.
## Features

- Browse the product listings to find items of interest.
- Click the "Add to Cart" button to add items to your cart.
- Adjust item quantities using the < and > buttons in the cart.
- View the total price dynamically calculated as you interact with the cart.
- Even if you revisit the site later, cart remains unchanged.
